\end{goddesc}
Kurutlmac, the god of Kobolds, is quite possibly the least powerful deity in all of Spirals.
Much like the race he watches over, he is timid, meek, and ultimately worthless.

\subsubsection*{Personality}
Despite his near-total lack of power, Kurtulmac is a surprisingly personable god.
He is fully aware that he is useless, and uses self-deprecating humor to take advantage of this fact.
He is also extremely kind to his Kobolds, especially after their deaths (which happen quite frequently).

\subsubsection*{Physical Appearance}
Kurtulmac looks like a glowing Kobold, slightly taller than the normal members of his race.
He has red scales, and speaks with a cockney accent.

\subsubsection*{World Temple Room}
Much like the god himself, his room in the world temple is meek and small.
Approximately sixty square feet, it consists of little more than a throne made of bronze and a few torches.

\QuoteAttr{Unofficial motto of Tediorus' Clerics}
Tediorus is the god of menial tasks.
Taking out the garbage, sweeping a floor, exterminating rats---all such things belong to this god's domain.

\subsubsection*{Personality}
Tediorus is quite possibly the most boring thing in all of existence.
They feel no emotion or passion, instead executing the duties of godhood with almost robot-like efficiency.

Tediorus has some clerics, who seek to increase the amount of menial work in the world due to their belief that it "builds character."
This leads to them intentionally setting up menial tasks to be done: filling basements with giant rats, conjuring garbage to be put away, and disorganizing filing cabinets.
Adventurers who are just starting out on their journey may visit one of his temples to train their fundamental skills and to prepare themselves for the more difficult tasks of the profession.

\subsubsection*{Physical Appearance}
Tediorus, as one might expect, looks average.
He is exactly average height, has light-brown hair and brown eyes, and no distinctive facial features whatsoever.

\subsubsection*{World Temple Room}
Tediorus's World Temple room is little more than a white cube.
Tediorus sits in the middle on a plain-looking rocking chair, not speaking as he sews patches into shirts or mends handheld tools.
