\subsection{Variant Rule: Extremely Wild Magic}
The naturally wild nature of magic in Spirals makes being a sorcerer even more taxing.
Those who use wild magic may occasionally experience effects even more random than normal.

Using this variant rule, wild magic sorcerers get a very small chance to lose control of their magic in a \textit{ridiculous} way.
Whenever you roll a 1 on the wild magic dice, an additional D20, and a D8.\footnote{If you rarely have a wild magic sorcerer roll a wild magic dice, you may want to remove the d8 from the equation.}
If both are one, roll on the extremely wild magic table to see what sort of effect manifests.

Be warned that the effects of this rule will make your campaign quite silly.
Many will grant your sorcerer or one of his allies a new ability, permanently effect their appearance, or otherwise destroy any sense of narrative cohesion on your campaign.
The chances of getting to roll on the Supremely Wild Magic table are $ \frac{1}{3200} $, but the effects are potentially cataclysmic, and could derail your entire campaign in a glorious way.

\begin{rolltable}{Supremely Wild Magic}
\item[1-2] Roll on this table at the start of your turn for the next two minutes.
If you get this item again, the duration is refreshed.
Duration can be refreshed a maximum of twice.
If your roll lands on this, strap in.
You're about to see some serious shit.
\item[3-4] Gain a new class ability, \textit{Ultimate Perception.}
This ability may be cast after a short rest.
Roll a d20.
On a 20, you gain vision through the eyes of every creature within a 300-foot radius of where you cast it.
The effect lasts until the creatures die, or \textbf{you} leave the radius---the creatures may leave, and you retain vision.
\item[5-6] You burst into flames. You take four times your maximum health as damage.
You can chose one target within 10 feet of you to also take this damage.
If this spell kills you (which it most likely will), you instantly and inexplicably gain a cosmically significant position in whatever your afterlife would be, of your DM's choosing.
\item[6-7] A tarrasque appears 2d100 squares away from you. 
It heads for the nearest populated area at its maximum movement seed. 
The tarrasque disappears after two hours.
\item[7-8] You (and all allies within 100 feet) instantly change race in terms of appearance, gaining the new race's bonuses, and retaining those of your old race.

\item[9-10] The world wants to kill you for 1d4 days.
Every five minutes, \textit{Meteor Storm} will be cast at whatever position you were at in the previous round, until you die, or the duration of the effect ends.

You will become physically sick if you do not increase your net worth by at least 5\% every week, gaining disadvantage on WIS and DEX saving throws if you fail to do so.
You gain advantage on all checks relating to the appraisal of wealth, as well as Persuasion checks when buying or selling items.
\item[17-18]  Roll a d4. Your height permanently increases by the result, in feet.
\item[19-20] The heat around you spontaneously vanishes.
All creatures in a 30-foot radius of you take 10d10 ice damage. 
If a creature dies as a result of this roll, their body becomes an ice sculpture.
\item[21-22] You feel the power of sacrifice within you.
You gain the ability to heal up to three creatures to full whenever you reduce yourself to negative hit points.
When you perform this sacrifice, you lose the ability to be magically healed until you are non-magically restored to consciousness.
Recharges on a long rest.
\item[23-24] You and all creatures you can see suddenly become magically attracted to a faraway tendril. 
You will fall towards it, upwards through the air, until you touch down on its surface.
Your falling speed is capped to 20 $\frac{m}{s}$.
The fall may take several days, or even weeks, at the discretion of your DM.
\item[25-26] You permanently grow feathers all over your body, and gain the ability to speak to birds.
\item[27-28] You permanently grow a pair of wings, gaining a flying speed equal to your walking speed if unarmored, or wearing armor specially deigned to allow you to use the wings.

Immediately afterwards, you will fall unconscious for 4d8+12 hours.
You gain the ability to manifest this effect once every four months.
\item[47-48] You and all creatures within 400 feet become Tyrannosaurus Rexes.
You alone keep your ability to cast spells, although everybody keeps their normal stats and intelligence.
This effect may only be reversed by the usage of a \textit{Greater Restoration} spell, although it may be difficult to convince a cleric to cast it on your party---especially since you can't speak in anything that isn't a roar.
\item[49-50] The magic around you is so eager to help you that it forgets about gravity for a moment.
You (and all other creatures you can see) become weightless for fifteen minutes.

\item[71-72] All your skin appears to fall off, revealing the muscles and organs beneath. 
Somehow, you are unharmed.
Your skin will grow back in 1d4 weeks, however, whenever you drop to zero hit points, it will fall off again.
Medicine checks against you have advantage while skinless.
You also gain advantage on intimidation checks, owing to your horrifying appearance, with the penalty of disadvantage on persuasion checks.
