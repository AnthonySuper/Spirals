The following document was found in the library of the College Dé Arcana, shoved rather clumsily onto the shelves between two volumes of an encyclopedia of monsters. It has been rewritten in a more readable format by apprentice wizard Scutt Synsons. The information within cannot be verified.

\begin{loggentry}{2 Days Past Arrival}{Time at Last}
It is with great pleasure that I find myself able to write again, and to chronicle the strange things which I have seen.
In truth, I can still hardly believe them, and I hope that organizing my thoughts on paper will help me understand what exactly has happened to me.
I must admit, even now, the familiarity of the pen in my hand brings me some comfort.

I am Adoven Swordhand, wizard hailing from Impiltur.
I swear on penalty of death that all I write in this journal is a true chronicle of my time in the land known as ``Spirals,'' regardless of how impossible or unlikely it may seem.

To begin with, perhaps I should explain how I came to arrive in this strange place---or, at least, to explain what happened, as the exact mechanisms of ``how'' are still unknown to me.
In truth, there is not much to tell.
I was preparing myself to retire to my bedchambers, eagerly looking forward to a long night's rest, when I felt a strong tug on my ankle, as if someone had grasped it.
Immediately, my vision went black.

When I could see again, I found myself in a strange circumstance.
I was sitting on a cold stone floor, still in my bedclothes.
Around me stood five people: two I recognized as human, a dwarf, an elf, and a dragonborn with brilliant red scales.
They were all standing in a circle, surrounding me with weapons drawn.

I immediately rose my hands and shouted my surrender, but this seems to have been unneeded.
One of the humans, a blonde woman with a series of scars across her face, stepped forward and used some sort of magic on me, chanting in a language I did not know.
I was unaffected, and her scowl soon turned into a smile as she greeted me, explaining that they had in their company a sorcerer with magic which occasionally ran out of control.

She offered a hand, which I shook, unsure of what else to do.
I asked where I was, and she replied that I was ``Inside of Deramth.''
When I inquired further, she said that it was ``Branched off of Paca, about five hundred miles up-Tendril.''

I swore under my breath and asked what she meant, fearing that she was insane.
Instead, her face contorted in concern, and she asked where, exactly, I was previously.

I told her, and the concern in her brow deepened.
She reassured me that they would figure out what had happened, but also informed me that we needed to leave the place in which we were.

The party set out, forming a circle around me as we moved out of the square room and into a circular hallway.
The hallway seemed to be a tube, of some sort, surrounded on all sides by black rock.
We moved down this corridor for perhaps a mile, then the party stopped and looked upwards.
Embedded in the ceiling was a small porthole, shining light downwards.

It was at this point that the dragonborn began to move towards this porthole, stepping sideways across the surface of the tube.
Soon he was at an angle far too steep for him to remain upright, and within seconds was walking vertically.

I informed the group that I did not have such magic to walk upon walls, and suggested that they lower a rope to me.
They looked at me strangely, then encouraged me to walk forward.
Incredulous, I stepped up the tube as well, bracing myself for the inevitable fall I would take when the floor got too steep.

To my surprise, however, I did not fall.
In fact, I never even felt as if I was at an incline.
As I walked, it seemed more like the floor was rotating around me.
I quickly realized that this was impossible, as there were others walking upon it---instead, it was gravity itself that was behaving strangely.
Instead of being pulled downwards, I was being pulled \textit{towards the ground}. 

We eventually reached the porthole.
I stepped inside, and soon found myself flat on my stomach in the middle of a patch of grass.

Even in the dim light, I quickly noticed something troubling: there was nothing beyond the field.
There was no forest, nor a sea, nor a lake, nothing but a vast, starless sky, the only light provided by a strange spiderweb of faintly glowing lines.
The end of the world seemed to stand in front of me, and the land itself stopped with the field.
In the other direction, to my left, this was not the case.
The land there stretched out until my vision gave way, forming a relatively normal horizon, save for the fact that it was cut off in both of my peripherals.
One of the bands of light in the sky ran perpendicular to it, moving straight upwards at a right angle.

Before I had any chance to ask further questions, the group that had summoned me moved towards four strange objects.
Made of iron, they consisted of a large leather saddle atop an arched iron frame.
The two ends of the arches glowed with a bluish tint.
At what I assumed to be the front end was another arch of iron, this one moving upwards.
This arch soon split into two handles, like one may see on a plow.

The group all mounted these saddles, and the woman motioned for me to sit behind her.
She had a strange, dangerous air about her as she asked if I had written a ``landcycle'' before.

I replied that I had not.
She smirked, and advised me to hold on tight.
I immediately leaned forward and grasped her armor with all my strength, suddenly frightened.
She waited until I was secured, then leaned forward and grasped the handles.

Immediately, the vehicle shot off.
I expected it to be fast, perhaps as quick as a galloping horse.
In truth, my imaginations had not been nearly wide enough.
Within moments we were moving at such a speed that I could hardly see more than a blur of color.

We moved in the direction of the normal horizon, although we occasionally traveled left or right.
I soon realized that the field did not, in fact, simply stop, but instead curved out of my vision.
The group exploited this curve to move around simply.

The line of light in the sky soon began to glow brighter, increasing in width.
Eventually, I could start to make out actual features instead of simple light, dirt and streams, even lakes.
It was not a simple source of light.
It was another tube of land, which connected to the one we were on.
This one, however, was far, far wider.
Soon it was the only thing visible in the direction we traveled in.

For a moment I was afraid we were driving directly into our deaths via impact, but the vehicle soon decreased in speed.
By the time we reached the point where our landmass connected with the other, we were moving along at only twice the speed of a gallop, which seemed downright reasonable compared to our previous velocity.

The landmasses connected to each other via a smooth curve.
We rode along it slowly, although I still felt pressed into my seat by our changing direction.

Once we were entirely on the larger landmass, we gained speed again.
This time, however, we did not move through a grassy field.
We soon found a dry patch of dirt that I identified as a road.

We were not alone on this road.
Other things traveled with us, great, screaming boxes of iron and wood.
They, impossibly, moved even faster than us, traveling in a perfectly straight line as they passed us by.

Our excursion stopped at a small town, where we rented a room at an inn.
I dismounted the vehicle and almost collapsed, worn from my ordeal.
My joints and head both ached, and I still felt a horrific nausea.

The paladin helped me to a nearby inn, purchased a room for me, and carried me up the stairs, placing me in my bed.
Within seconds I was asleep.

I am writing this the next morning.
When I awoke, I asked if they could be so kind as to purchase me some parchment and a pen, so I could chronicle what had happened when it was still fresh in my mind.
The group happily obliged, purchasing me this wonderful leather-bound volume.

As I write this, I am eating a meal which is fit for a king, containing eggs and meat as well as grain.
Shockingly, this was purchased for only a single piece of copper.

Although I am well educated, and even better-traveled, I have never heard of such a place.
It is clear that the plane I am on is material, but it is also quite possible I am the only person to visit it.
Why, exactly, I have been fated to be pulled into this land is unclear.
Soon, I shall talk with the group who have accidentally summoned me, to better understand what has happened, and what has transpired.
Hopefully, they may provide clarity upon this manner.
