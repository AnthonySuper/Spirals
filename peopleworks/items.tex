The world of Spirals has some special items that make the setting work well 

\section{Vehicles} 
\subsection{Landcycles}
The primary form of personal transportation in Spirals is the landcycle.
These vehicles use the magic that holds the spirals up to travel long distances at extreme speeds.
Landcycles are a common piece of technology, and can generally be acquired cheaply.
They can be made from various materials, ranging from wood to metal to strange matter.
However, they have a few important catches:
\begin{description}
\item[Limited Carrying Capacity:] Landcycles can carry only approximately four hundred pounds.
If one wishes to transport a larger weight, they need to look for other options.
\end{description}


\todo[inline]{Landcycles in-game are much, much faster than this table. Fix it!}

Name & Material & Cost (GP) & Range (mi) & Speed (MPH) & Downtime (hours) & Startup Time (minutes) \\
\hline
Jaunter & Wood & 100 & 200 & 45 &10 & 15 \\

Cityrunner & Wood/Metal & 200 & 500 & 60 & 7 & 15 \\

\hline
Blackbird & Steel & 10,000 & 2500 & 250 & 10 & 5 \\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\subsection{Landchewers}
A slightly less common (and much more expensive) form of transportation is the Landchewer.
While not as fast, or as maneuverable, they are able to transport much heavier goods.

\section{Magical Items}
Spirals comes with a few unique magical items.

\subsection*{Elvesbane}
Elvesbane is a feared, legendary plant.
Said to be made from the essence of Lolth herself, it grows in the darkest, deepest places of the underdark.
When one soaks the root of an Elvesbane plant in boiling water, the resulting brew is a brutally efficient poison which works exclusively on elves.
With just one sip, an elf is doomed to die as all of their internal organs liquify---and no magic can save them.
Legend has it that drinking an entire pot would kill even Correllon him/herself.
