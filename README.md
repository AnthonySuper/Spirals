This repository contains the source code for a D&D 5th edition setting's guidebooks.
The two subfolders represent two different guidebooks.
The `guidebook` subfolder contains the main book, intended for use by DMs who wish to run a game in the setting.
The `player_book` subfolder contains a smaller guidebook, intended for players who are going to be playing in the setting.


In order to build these guidebooks, you will need a copy of LaTeX.
LaTeX is free and open source software, and can easily be obtained from [this page](https://www.latex-project.org/get/), or your package manager if you are using Linux.
