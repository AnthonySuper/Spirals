\section{The Confused Mountain}
The confused mountain is one of the stranger structures in spirals.
It is formed by six tendrils, three which branch off the Frozen Tendril, and three which branch off the Caldus.
They spiral around each other, forming the mesh outline of a cone and meeting at the center.
The result is a mountain-like structure that's half frozen and half desert, with stripes of either terrain running up its side.
The Confused Mountain is a popular subject for artists due to its natural beauty and inherent commentary on the nature of life, and is a symbol of the struggle between fanaticism and indifference in several religions.
