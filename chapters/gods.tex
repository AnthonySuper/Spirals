\chapter{Gods}
The gods of Spirals are extremely close to the activities of mortals.
They are often physically present in the \hyperref[worldtemple]{World Temple (described in \autoref{worldtemple})}, and most have numerous clerics.
The pantheon of Spirals takes inspiration from that of Forgotten Realms, although some familiar faces have different personalities.
